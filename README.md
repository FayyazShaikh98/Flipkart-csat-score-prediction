# Flipkart-csat-score-prediction

# Objective:
The aim of this project is to develop a classification model to predict customer satisfaction scores for Flipkart. This predictive model will help the company identify areas for improvement in customer experience and optimize their marketing and service strategies, ultimately enhancing customer retention and satisfaction.

# Dataset Overview:
The dataset comprises 20 columns, with several features showing a strong correlation to customer behavior. Key customer-related variables includes Order_ID, Order_date_time, Customer_City, Item_Price, Channel_Name, and Customer_Remarks. Additionally, key operational variables include Issue_Responded_at, Issue_Responded, Survey_Response_Date, Product_Category, Agent_Name, Supervisor, Manager, Agent_Shift, and Sub_Category. The target variable is the CSAT Score, which ranges from 1 to 5, indicating customer satisfactionâ€”higher scores reflect greater satisfaction.

# Data Manipulation:
The date variables were converted from object type to datetime format for improved processing. The Connected_Handling_Time column was removed due to having 99% of its values as null. Additionally, any rows with null values in the Order_ID column were eliminated. To address missing data, null values in categorical columns, including Customer_City, Customer_Remarks, and Product_Category, as well as in numeric columns like Item_Price, Issue_Reported_at, and Issue_Responded, were filled appropriately.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
The EDA phase involved a comprehensive exploration of the dataset to uncover trends, patterns and relationships that could inform the model-building process.

# Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Handling Missing Data: The dataset was evaluated for missing values, and suitable imputation strategies were implemented to maintain data integrity.

# Feature Engineering:
Data Types: The year, month, day, hour, and minute were extracted from the Order_Date_Time column to derive additional valuable insights.

Outliers: The Item_Price column was analyzed for outliers using the IQR method, leading to the removal of 23.85% of data points that fell outside acceptable limits.

Encoding: One-Hot Encoding was applied to categorical features such as Channel_name and Product_Category.

# Univariate Analysis:
Histograms and box plots were employed to analyze the distribution of continuous variables like Item_price and CSAT Score.

# Data Splitting:
The data was split into training and test sets with an 80-20 ratio. Several classification models were trained, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, kNeighbors and Extratrees classifier. Hyperparameter tuning was performed, focusing on F1-Score as the primary evaluation metric to balance precision and recall.

# Model Evaluation:
The models were evaluated using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy. The Extra trees model exhibited the best performance, particularly in terms of precision and accuracy, making it the model of choice. The confusion matrix and ROC-AUC curve further supported the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between satisfied and dissatisfied customers. Feature Importance:

The model identified Customer_Remarks, issue_responded, Channel_name and category as the most significant factors influencing customer satisfaction. This suggests that Customer_Remarks, issue_resoponded are crucial for enhancing customer satisfaction.

# Conclusion:
The final model successfully predicts customer satisfaction scores with high precision. This model can be deployed to enhance Flipkart's customer experience initiatives, ensuring that resources are allocated to customers with the highest potential for satisfaction. Insights from feature importance analysis can guide strategic decisions in marketing and service improvements.
